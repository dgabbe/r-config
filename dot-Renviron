# .Renviron lives in your home directory.
#
# It's purpose is to define environment variables for R in a platform 
# independent way.
# 
# R's startup process is documented at https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Startup.html
#
# There are different ways to configure your system to use this file.
#
# The simplest:
#   1. copy dot-Renviron to your home directory.
#   2. rename the file to be .Renviron
#
# However if you manage this file w/a version control system, it's tedious manual
# work and things can get out of sync.
#
# The git way:
#   1. Fork this project to your local system
#   2. Create a symlink, $HOME/.Renviron to point to <your local git repo>/dot-Renviron
#   3. Create a symlink, $HOME/Rprofile.site to point to <your local git repo>/Rprofile.site
#

R_PROFILE=~/Rprofile.site
