# Minor revision upgrades frequently cause loading errors similar to:
# 1: dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...)
# 2: library.dynam(lib, package, package.lib)
#
# Experience has shown that packages loaded in .First() trip this error.
# R commands helpful for diagnosing:
#    .libPaths()
#    .Library
#    Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_USER")
#    sessionInfo()
#    readRenviron(path)
