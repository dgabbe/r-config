### Purpose and Features

Customize your R environment for R scripts and R GUIs (RStudio) independently of
your .bash files while keeping the files under source code control. You can
easily maintain the same environment across multiple computers. The user
profile, `.Rprofile`, is left available to use in your `$HOME` directory or your
project's working directory.

Review and edit `.First()` in `Rprofile.site` and `dot-Renviron` to set R's options to your
preferences.

To save disk space and prevent reinstalling libraries when a new version of R is installed, 
the major versions use the same library, i.e.`~/Library/R/3.x/library/`, which is defined 
by `R_LIBS_USER`.

Jump to the [Installation](#installation). Read [Release Notes](NEWS.md).

### Diagnosing & Correcting Errors From Minor R Release Updates

Keeping a common library across the same major version of R can create some
mischief when you install a minor update. For example, 3.3 to 3.4.0.  The error
I end up fixing is about loading and the first 2 lines are similar to:
```
1: dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...)
2: library.dynam(lib, package, package.lib)
```

#### RStudio Hangs With A Blank Screen On Startup
It's a bit vexing when RStudio hangs on startup with a blank screen.  It's not
the fault of RStudio, but almost always of `.First()` loading `devtools`. Run R, 
which on a Mac is `/Applications/R.app`, to see the error.

#### Code Throws An Error About Loading
RStudio runs, but your code errors out with a stack trace indicating a loading 
problem.  If you updated R while RStudio was running, try quitting and restarting 
RStudio.  Continue reading if the error still occurs.

#### How to Fix
The load errors happen because your R library, pointed to by `R_LIBS_USER`, has 
packages installed which were built with an earlier version of R. When a new version
of R is installed, its internals are newer and the version skew may 
be causing the error.

If RStudio hung, run R to find which package caused the error and move the 
offending package folder out of `R_LIBS_USER`.  Repeat until RStudio starts.  

Run `.libPaths()` to verify your library path is as intended.  If R created `~/Library/R/3.4/library`,
delete it now. Now copy the package folder back.  Run `update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)`.
Quit RStudio, and then restart it to confirm the error is fixed.  More details can be found 
in this excellent post, https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/upgrade-R.html.

Other commands that are helpful:

* `.Library`
* `Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_USER")`
* `sessionInfo()`
* `readRenviron(path)`

### Installation

Follow these steps to install:
```
mkdir ~/rprofile.site
cd ~/rprofile.site
git init
git clone https://github.com/dgabbe/rprofile.site.git --branch Current
```
To complete the configuration, continue using the command line with this command
```
./installer.command
```
or return to the Finder and double click on `installer.command`.

If there is an existing `Rprofile.site`, it is renamed to `Rprofile.site.org`. 
Now edit `Rprofile.site` to make sure it has the options set to your preferences.  
Repeat for `.Renviron`.  Startup R or RStudio to verify a message like the one below is displayed:
```
23-Oct-2016 ~/Rprofile.site .First() starting...

    Option StringsAsFactors:   FALSE
    Option download.file.method:   libcurl
    Option repos:   https://cran.rstudio.com/
    Option defaultPackages: datasets, utils, grDevices, graphics, stats,
        methods

23-Oct-2016 ~/Rprofile.site .First() finished...
```

If you want to remove this setup:

```
~/rprofile.site/uninstaller.command
mv Rprofile.site.org Rprofile.site # only if you had one before
```

### Use .First() or Packages to Customize

There are plenty of examples of `.Rprofile` or `Rprofile.site` that
include functions or more generically, R objects.  At first, I thought this was
a great idea, but I have found better ways.  Here are some points to keep in mind:

1. When `Rprofile.site` is executed, any objects are created
in the `base` environment unless coded otherwise.
2. Storing the objects in `.GlobalEnv` (RStudio's Environment tab displays
`Global Environment`) avoids modifying `base`, but your changes are not
permanent.  Clearing the Global Environment will delete your objects. Some
examples work around this behavior by creating a hidden environment and then
adding their objects to it.  However, RStudio's *delete all saved objects*
(![broom](./broom.png)) default is to include hidden objects.
3. Don't assume your R session is initialized only
once.  R and RStudio have slightly different behaviors.  RStudio's
*Session->Restart R* does not clear out the Global Environment, but does run the
R [initialization
process](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Startup.html).
The `devtools::` functions do as well.

The idiom `option("defaultPackages" =
c(getOption("defaultPackages"), "package1", "package2""))` ends up appending
your packages each time R initializaton runs.  Since R will only load a library
once, there is no change to your environment, but it's poor technique.

If you still want default packages loaded, try this:
```
.First <- function() {
  suppressMessages(require("package1", quietly = TRUE))
  suppressMessages(require("package2", quietly = TRUE))
}
```
If you use `library()`, instead of `require()`, any error will stop the initialization
process.  It should take more than a missing package to bring the initialization
to a halt.

R's package facility provides a great solution. Writing a package will make you
a better R programmer, your code will have fewer collisions with other R code,
and RStudio's deployment features will manage the packages needed.

Remember, loading is different from attaching packages.  Once a package is
*installed*, `install.packages()`, its functions can be called with
`package::function()` syntax.  The `library` function will attach the package to
the current environment and make it part of the namespaces that are searched.
